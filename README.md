## Abstract
Machine learning for agriculture is a vast field of deploying machine learning models for enhancing crop yield and nutrition. Tomato is a staple diet crop suffering from pest damage and drought, resulting in lower yield and financial loss for farmers. This paper explores basic machine learning models on tomato pest image classification and their performance. The dataset consists of 4263 images of eight common tomato pests. We have performed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier and KNN on the Tomato pest dataset. The Random Forest classifier has achieved 46\% accuracy and an F1 score of 42\% by outperforming other models. Support Vector Machine also shows significant accuracy of 41\% and F1 score of 35\%. We have used the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and confusion matrices to validate the performance of Machine learning models on each class of Tomato Pest Dataset. The performance of Machine learning models is not optimal as they are not hyperparameter tuned. The class imbalance of the Tomato Pest Dataset also affects the model‚Äôs performance. These results indicate that we need to use Deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural networks, which can be considered as our future direction.
